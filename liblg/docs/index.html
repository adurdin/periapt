<h1><a href="tutorial.html">Building OSM Modules</a></h1>
<p>A description of how to build an OSM module.</p>
<p>I apologize for not having a working MSVC project file. But it's even less fair to withhold useful information just because of a few pesky incompatibilities. I hope to soon rectify the omission. In the meantime, the <code>MSVC</code> folder contains the broken workspace and project files.</p>

<h1>Structured Data Reference</h1>
<ul>
  <li><a href="thief1-data.html">Thief 1/G</a></li>
  <li><a href="thief2-data.html">Thief 2</a></li>

</ul>
<p>Listings of all properties, links, and reactions along with field names and enumeration values. Each table begins with the internal name of the property/link/reaction and the public name as it appears in Dromed. (The public name of a link flavor is the same as the internal name.) If the data is a simple type, the last column describes the type. The field names and types for complex data are listed with a one-column indent. When a data type or field has an enumerated value or bitfield flags, the symbolic names and values are listed with a two-column indent.</p>
<p>When using data fields, all characters, including white-space, are significant.</p>
<p>These tables do not reflect the internal arrangement of the data. You should only use them with the structured data interfaces of the Dark Engine.</p>
<p>The tables look best when printed in landscape mode.</p>
